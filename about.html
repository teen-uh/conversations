    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><i>Conversations over a website</i> is a rudimentary web project inspired by the conversations that many of us may have while a website is open.
    It is also inspired by the poem “FOUR FRIENDS CATCH UP OVER PASTA” by Amy Kay. Maybe the stories were a tad drawn from my own experience but hopefully
    it can remind you to think about yours too. How did you grow up over websites? Which pages do you no longer visit and which videos haven't you seen in a long time?
