      <i>Conversations over a website</i> is a ode to...well...the conversations
      that we have over a website, or many. It's inspired by "FOUR FRIENDS CATCH
      UP OVER PASTA" by Amy Kay, where the story of this friendship is told
      through snippets of dialogue. In a similar way, I feel like growing up
      with digital spaces and the Internet has changed our childhoods and coming
      of age stories. I wondered if there was a more naive and simple way to
      approach surveillance in this sense. What are the casual conversations
      that you have when a website is open? As a whole, this website/collection
      of sites is supposed to be a little fun, a little nostalgic, and to prompt
      our thoughts on how our memories are logged. The ideal user of is website
      is people who grew up with the Internet. Probably, 90s and 00s kids. The
      idea that the internet was growing and shifting alongside us is a very
      specific memory. The Wayback Machine may not bring a ton of nostalgia for
      those that grew up beyond that initial age of the Internet. I hope that
      these users can look for their own story in the one that I'm showcasing on
      the website. Not all of us share the same nostalgic sites or stories but
      we all have them and the different connections between moments of our life
      and those sites. I made this website due to a sudden moment of nostalgia?
      or gratitude? After reading Amy's poem, I thought it was beautiful how
      years of friendship and knowledge could be captured by reading between the
      lines. As the creator, this initial story is mine, the websites I grew up
      with and the stages of life I found myself in when I visited those
      websites. It's a little personal but I hope that it provokes some thought
      and nostalgic memories. There are many limitations of my site, the biggest
      one being that I wanted to essentially replicate each individual site and
      truly edit the DOM to be interactive and have the story be narrated
      through different elements. Doing that from scratch would've been
      incredibly time consuming but also just getting the sites from the Wayback
      Machine obviously doesn't allow you to access the entire website perfectly
      either. I would also like to write a stronger narrative, at least in a way
      that reflects how I would speak when I was younger. I don't really know
      how to think like that anymore. The next iteration of this would still
      include conversations had over websites but I'd love to have many
      forgeries of websites where I can have the conversations carry out across
      the entire page with interactions on buttons or silly popups and all that.
      I hope for it to run smoother and more as a cohesive movie. Aesthetically,
      I just wish every webpage would be a really good replication of the site
      that it's mimicking. I had issues with videos and lost files so ideally it
      would feel more like a time machine.
